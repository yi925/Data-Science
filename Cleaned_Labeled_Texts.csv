"The Roe versus Wade 1973 judgement, which helped legalise abortion in the United States, is in danger of being overturned by their Supreme Court justices. This is rightfully causing great consternation. If reversed, it would deprive women of the right over their own bodies, thereby infringing their constitutional right to liberty. It also impinges on their right to life; pregnancy-induced physiological changes render a woman more vulnerable to morbidity and death; therefore, the choice to be a mother must be hers. Criminalising abortion forces women who seek it (for a multitude of compelling social and personal reasons) to get it done quietly in unsafe conditions thus putting their lives in danger (4.7-13.2 per cent of the maternal mortality which currently stands at 152/100000 live births internationally is due to unsafe abortions). As per WHO research, 45 per cent of the overall abortions performed are unsafe as they are carried out surreptitiously in countries that have officially made it illegal. This cohort of women therefore unfairly gets excluded from the excellent advances in medical science that all other citizens enjoy. The right to an abortion (medical termination of pregnancy) on demand is available in only about 27 per cent of countries though many do allow it on various medical and social grounds and almost all countries allow it as a life-saving measure. In Ireland, the right to abortion was introduced only in 2018, after the public outcry following the preventable death of Savita Halappanavar who was not allowed even a life-saving abortion. The upper time limit of a legal abortion ranges from 12 to 24 weeks (these decisions are based on the age of viability of the foetus and maternal safety). In India, it is thankfully allowed for 28 weeks (with some caveats). To read more tap link in bio",Neutral
